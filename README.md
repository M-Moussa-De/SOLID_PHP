# SOLID in PHP

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented programming and design.
These principles, when followed, can make it easier to create software that is maintainable, flexible, and scalable.

- Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Abstractions should not depend on details.

These principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob."

## Guideline

The project has a php folder which includes the implementations for the 5 principles in PHP.

The way I'm going to work is, that I'll write code which violates the SOILD principles, after that
I'll show how to refactor it to adhere to the principles.
